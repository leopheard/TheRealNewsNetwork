<a href="kodi.tv">KODI<a> / XBMC / Firestick addon for the <a href="https://therealnews.com/">The Real News Network</a> audio and video streams.<br>

<a href="https://therealnews.com/">TRNN</a> is a daily multi-media news and documentary service, headquartered in Baltimore. What makes us different from other news sources is our business model. We are nonprofit and do not accept funding from advertisers, governments, or corporations. TRNN is sustained by viewer donations, foundations, and earned revenue. This independence allows us to follow facts to rational conclusions, without the editorial pressures felt by for-profit, advertising-driven news models.<br>

<a href="www.kodi.tv">Kodi</a> (formerly known as XBMC) is an award-winning free and open source (GPL) software media player and entertainment hub that can be installed on Linux, OSX, Windows, iOS and Android, featuring a 10-foot user interface for use with televisions and remote controls.
